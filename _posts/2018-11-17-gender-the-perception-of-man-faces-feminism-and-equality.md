			<h2>Gender: The perception of Man faces feminism and equality</h2>		
		<p>Everything comes from our imagination. Gender equality has and always been a debate. Feminism has been an on-going theory. </p><p>As Filipinos, we were thought to respect and honour our mothers. We know that there are issues among our society about women in every aspect. Thus, we must continue to respect women. As the Golden Rule says “Do not do unto others what you don’t want others to do unto you.” Equal rights and opportunity have been a longstanding debate but most importantly we must love and respect one another. I agree that in order for men and women to be totally equal we must acknowledge first that we are all unique and our differences must not be a means to belittle others.</p><p>I realized that I am guilty of gender and feminist issues. I know that women have voices but still, it is men who make decisions. As an active Catholic Christian, I believed that wife must submit to their husband. It is true that it must be followed but things have changed. Women suffer and men abuse this power. To submit does not mean you must follow but to respect. The materials provided as listed on the references below exceeds my expectations about feminism and gender and the role of multimedia. I learned that “Feminism is for everybody.” It aims to end domination in order to free us to be who we truly are. Thus, we can live in peace and love justice. (Hooks, B. 2000)</p><p>Gender is how we perceive a person within our society. Equality between men and women is a longstanding debate. Love and respect are needed so we can live in peace and love justice.</p><p>Our language is created for man which means a person either male or female have pertaining references. The incorporations of gender on language representations were added in order to be specific and detailed. Gender, as it has been described, is a social perception. Society let us categorize people as masculine and feminine. Nowadays, it is different. We have gay, bisexual, lesbian and transgender. These are the categories provided by the society. They call it the distinction of groups. We made have had fun in producing these names but still for me we are man and woman. Indeed, there are groups in our society that are isolated but as a man, they have equal rights too. In Politics, gender has always been an issue. As the society rules favourable for the superior men. Labour workforce in a factory, sex tourism and trafficking women, colonization and gender revolution. We must take action to liberate gender and feminism. </p><p>Feminism is the qualities of a female. Women are the oppressed sex. Some believed that women are not entitled to equal rights. I believed that everyone regardless of sex and gender is equal. We have different strengths and weakness that completes our individuality. Inferiority is just an attitude that most of Filipinos absorbed. Women suffer from discrimination, including her race. How many Overseas Filipino Workers maids have been molested and died? How many women have been victims of trafficking overseas? If inferior men were slaves then women are what? Trophies of superior men? Today it is no longer just women who experience inferiority but also men. Men that are called by society as gay or lesbian. If we are to think, is this an extension of the feminist struggle to continuously fight for equality? Or is this a representation that men are capable of truly being superior? Let’s think about it. Theories about gender and feminism from post-colonial to present are very important to set the rights for equality. It is in place to guide us by examining the root and outcomes of every given situation. Now and then, we must voice out the experiences on gender racism especially in multimedia.  </p><p>Multimedia is now a means of gender issues. Pornography and violence against women. Reports indicated that violence victims are always women. Internet plays a big part now on gender violence environment. </p><p>Again, gender is how we perceive a person. With that said, gender equality has been a longstanding debate. Love and respect are needed so we can live in peace and justice. Gender is how a person perceives by society. Men are superior over women and feminism is the standard of a female. This has been a long-standing multimedia topic that we always see on the internet, social networking, television, movies, plays, etc. The society has created an enormous gap between sexes. These gender groups are like fraternities and sororities. United for a common goal to be heard and understood. Fighting for equal rights possessed by the superior man. We must promote public discussion for gender equality and eliminate gender violence most especially to women. </p><p>"We need a media that strengthens democracy and not a media that strengthens the government. We need a media that enriches public discourse, not one that enriches corporations".
